# org-drill
Clone of Paul Sexton's org-drill - the best one

This is just a backup of Paul Sexton's (eeeickythump's) org-drill plugin for org-mode, for spaced repetition testing in Emacs org-mode. I found that Phillip Lord's (the maintainer after 2019) version complicated things, was unmaintained, and sometimes just straight up didn't work. This is just the original org-drill.el source, with org-learn.el, its dependency. I won't be updating this, because I'm not a Emacs Lisp dev, just wanted a place to host it so I could use it with straight.el
